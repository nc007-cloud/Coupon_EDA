# Coupon_EDA
# Practical Application 1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

## Project Overview
This project seeks to answer the question: **Will a customer accept the coupon?** The goal is to use Python libraries such as `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn` to explore the provided dataset, generate statistical summaries, and create visualizations that demonstrate the differences between customers who accepted and rejected a driving-related coupon.

The analysis is presented in a Jupyter Notebook, which explores factors such as time, weather, destination, passengers, and coupon types that may influence whether a customer accepts the coupon.

## Files in This Repository
- **`coupon_acceptance_analysis.ipynb`**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis, including data exploration, visualization, and findings.
- **`coupons.csv`**: The dataset used for this analysis, which includes survey responses on coupon acceptance.
- **`nontechnical_report.docx`**: A brief non-technical report highlighting the key differences between customers who accepted and rejected the coupons. This report is intended for non-technical audiences, summarizing the findings from the analysis.

## Dataset Description
The dataset, `coupons.csv`, contains the following columns:
- **Y**: Indicates whether the customer accepted the coupon (`1` for acceptance, `0` for rejection).
- **coupon**: The type of coupon offered (e.g., restaurant, coffee house, bar).
- **destination**: The customer's destination during the scenario (e.g., home, work).
- **weather**: The weather conditions during the scenario (e.g., sunny, rainy).
- **passenger**: Who the customer was traveling with (e.g., alone, friends).
- **time**: The time of day during the scenario (e.g., 2 PM, 10 AM).
  
The dataset includes additional variables describing the conditions under which the coupon was offered and the customer's behavior.

## Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook (`coupon_acceptance_analysis.ipynb`) walks through the following key steps:
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: 
   - Missing values are handled, and the column names are cleaned.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: 
   - Basic descriptive statistics of the dataset.
3. **Visualizations**:
   - A series of visualizations generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to explore trends in coupon acceptance based on factors like coupon type, time of day, weather conditions, destination, and passengers.
4. **Findings and Recommendations**:
   - The notebook concludes with key findings on which factors most influence coupon acceptance and provides actionable recommendations for businesses.
